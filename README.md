# roguesquerie

A Rogue-like game.

## Overview

Everybody should write a Rogue-like at least once, right?

## Features

See the [specification document](docs/design/specification.md).

## Caveats

This project is not focused on the [2008 Berlin Interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike#Key_features) of a Rogue-like.

### Berlin Interpretation Criteria

- Strong consideration
    - Random dungeon creation
    - permadeath
    - turn-based
    - grid-based
    - non-modal
    - emergent gameplay (TIMTOWTDI)
    - resource management
    - hack and slash
    - exploration
    
- Additional consideration
    - usually single character
    - monsters have same behavioural options as players (re: item acquisition, magic, etc.)
    - tactical play may require repeated experimentation to determine a method for success
    - environment composed of rooms and corridors
    - player status is present on-screen throughout the game
