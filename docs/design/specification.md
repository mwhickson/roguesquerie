# Roguesquerie Specification

## Overview

Roguesquerie is a rogue-like computer game.

## Targeted Features

- single-character, custom characters (name, species, background, attributes)
- graphical, top-down, tile-based world exploration
- randomized level/quest design
- map reveal via "fog of war" lighting
- turn-based combat, including ranged combat and magic
- "safe haven" city level for healing, resting, treasure off-loading and re-equipping (uMoria was my first Rogue-like)
- Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and monsters to interact with, including dialogue/parley
- audio effects

## Under Review

- class/archetype vs equipment based character definition
- experience vs reputation based character progression
- adapt an existing RPG/Rogue-like rules system, or cobble together something bespoke
- city level weather conditions
- in-dungeon safe havens or shops
- permadeath

## Future Considerations

- multilingual content
- themability
- music
